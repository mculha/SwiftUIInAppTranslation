# Translation

Apple introduced a new Framework called Translation. The framework helps us to translate texts between supported languages.
> Translate text in your app from one language to another.

There are a few options to translate texts. The one is to present a translation sheet. Another one is using [**TranslationSession**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/translation/translationsession).
TranslationSession also supports batch translation if it is needed.

The video shows the three ways of translating texts, presenting the translation sheet, translating a particular text, and translating all of them.

**NOTE:** Translation Framework does **NOT** work on simulators. Just use real devices for testing
